## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

Used figures from previous weather analysis to make a web page summarizing various correlations (or lack thereof) between latitude and weather.  Analyzed cloudiness, humidity, max, temp, and wind speed.

Created individual pages for each plot and a nav-bar to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page (index.html), where a comparison of all of the plots is shown.  Also included is a page showing the data used to build the plots.
